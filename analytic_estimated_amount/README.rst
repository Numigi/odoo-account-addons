=========================
Analytic Estimated Amount
=========================

A field Estimated Amount is added to the analytic line.
When confirming a purchase or sale order, an analytic line is created with
an amount in the column Estimated Amount and 0 in the column Amount.

If the purchase or sale order line has no analytic account, then no
analytic line is created.
