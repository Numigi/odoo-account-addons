Account Closing Journal / Mis Builder
=====================================
This module is binding between account_closing_journal and `mis_builder <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder>`_.

.. contents:: Table of Contents

In the configuration of a Mis Report, I notice a new checkbox ``Exclude Closing Entries``.

.. image:: static/description/exclude_closing_entries.png

When this box is checked, all journal entries related to a closing journal are automatically
excluded from the report.
