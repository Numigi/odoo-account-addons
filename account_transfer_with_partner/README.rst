Account transfer with partner
=============================

This module allows to designate a partner for journal item as the active company partner in the case of payment with transfer type.

Overview
========

As a user with the ability to create payments in the "Accounting" application, I create a new transfer between accounts.


I confirmed the transfer and accessed the journal items.

I noticed that the partner information was associated with the active company.
